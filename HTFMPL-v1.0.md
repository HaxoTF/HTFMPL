# 🩵 HaxoTF's Multi-Purpose License (WIP)

> ⚠️ **This License is a WIP (Work In Progress) and doesn't have any real impact yet**. <br>
> Wait for the final commit before using it like a dumbass. <br>
> If you grab it while it's still a draft, **you are fully responsible** for whatever brain damage you cause - don't come crying to me, bozo. 🤡

This license is under `HTFMPL v1 BA AF`. For more information, read more [here](HTFMPL-v1.0.md). <br>
What? You really thought it would redirect to some boring garbage legal page? Dumbass, this shit is self-licensed. <br>
Now, read it carefully - or go cry about it 🥀

### 🧟 **Braindead Disclaimers**
- This license might look like a meme, but it's **legally binding.** Yes, *even the parts that roasts you like a rotisserie chicken*.

- All jokes, roasts, and name-calling are **satirical**, targeted at **no one specific.** *(Unless you're actually being a dumbass -- in that case do some self-reflection before whining)*

- If you're confused by basic-ass words like "use" or "credit" -- congratulations, you've officially failed the ***Common Sense Speedrun***. Please crawl back under your rock or even better, **re-roll to the closest kindergarten and try again.**

- This license is written this way to be **engaging,** not because I got dropped on my head as a kid. *(Though that might've helped.)*

- If you've got problem with that, the **safest move** is to just **not touch the damn work at all.**

- TL;DR: Just because I'm talking like a shitposting goblin doesn't mean you can ignore this. This ain't your grandma's EULA.

These bad boys are not part of HTFMPL and have no authority over this beast. <br>
I'm just listing them because I'm nice like that. 🎁

# 🚨 **Welcome To The Shitshow** 🚨
HTFMPL is public free-to-use License that values **simplicity**, **efficiency**, **transparency** and **readability** over the bloated-ass word count. Seriously... why the fuck would I waste your time writing 10000 pages of legal diarrhea?

It is written in **casual, chill** and **in-your-face** way to actually **catch your eye** and **not make you fall asleep mid-scroll**.

In my not-so-humble opinion, everyone should have full freedom to customize their terms however the hell they want - **and that's why i spend my precious gamer hours making this shit**.

As long as the terms are as **clear as Walmart after Black Friday** (which is actually *pretty damn clear* if you survive the stampede), it's all good.

Despite it's vulgar, joking tone, the license should be taken seriously - so don't fuck around or you gonna find out. (Greetings to any future courts reading this, lmao.)

The license is considered "work" itself, so if you're using it (bless your chaotic soul), you have **full rights to customize, remix, or use it** - **as long as you respect the terms of the original license** (HTFMPL v1 BA AF). <br>
In short: **Don't be a dick, respect my work**, and **we're all cool**. 🤝

<br>

# ‼️ **READ IT OR EAT SHIT!**
**Read it** before anything else - it might contain **very important as hell info**. <br>
Let's be real: most of this is **ass-covering legal crap**... but it's here for a reason.

- 🫵 **I Am Speaking Directly To You** <br>
When I say *"I"*, I mean **HaxoTF** - not some random dumbass. <br>
When I say *"you"*, I mean literally **you** reading this - no excuses, no "not me lol".

---

- 🌍 **It Ain't Public Domain, Dumbass** <br>
I know damn well what license I slapped on this. <br>
If you use **HTFMPL** for your own shit, you **must credit HaxoTF** and give it a different non-confusing name - or label it as *"Edited HTFMPL"*. <br>
Using it as a base = **copy-paste + tweaking it to your taste**. <br>
You also gotta include **your own terms**, either linked or slapped somewhere obvious to find. <br>
No shady shit. No *"oops I didn't know"* excuses.

---

- 💼 **I Am Not a Lawyer** <br>
I am just one guy, vibin' at home to the music drowning in snacks. <br>
This doc is made with good intentions, but hey - I might've fucked something up. <br>
If anything here turns out illegal or against your local law - just ignore that **part**. <br>
BUT, if you try to sue me over a typo - go douch glass 🖕 <br>
Also, if you catch the mistake, help me fix it. That's the vibe.

---

- 👾 **Law is a Final BOSS** <br>
If your local law says "nope," then guess what - **they win**. <br>
Always follow your country's laws. <br>
I am not here to start a beef with governments. <br>
Unless you're some smelly-ass dictator out here making another dumpster-fire Red Star OS while shitting on my community -- in that case, I hope you gonna drown in diarrhea. 🖕

---

- ❔ **This License Might Change** <br>
I, the one and only HaxoTF, reserve the right to fix, change, or yeet parts of the license - as long as I follow [my own damn rules](self-rules.md). <br>
Always check what version your are using - cause older ones might be outdated, buggy, or just plain ass.

---

- 🛡️ **Your Work is Your Responsibility** <br>
If someone breaks the rules while using your HTFMPL-covered work - that's *you* problem, not *me* problem. <br>
I gave you the terms. Use them. Defend yourself. <br>
I'll still be in your corner cheering. tho. 🩵

---

- 🧙‍♂️ **HTFMPL Ain't Magic Eraser** <br>
HTFMPL **can't override** the original rules of other people's work. <br>
If a dev says "your mod is ours now", and it was their rules to begin with - **HTFMPL won't save you.** <br>
It's not legal sledgehammer. Respect other people's shit.

---

- 🔁 **Updates Aren't Automatic** <br>
If new HTFMPL drops, your stuff **stays under the one you picked**, unless you change it manually. <br>
No automatic travels. No time travel. <br>
If you wanna stay fresh, **update it yourself**, chief.

---

- 🧱 **Wall of Shame** <br>
Listen up, gremlins: <br>
Break the rules of the license or HTFMPL covered-work, **and you're getting ban-listed.** <br>
Once you're on that list, it's ***"all rights reserved"*** for you. Go away, bye. 👋
---

- 💩 **I Don't Agree to Bullshit** <br>
If you think you can slap clown terms like: <br>
*"HaxoTF owes me 3 billion dollars if someone farts wrong"* <br>
Nah. That's **invalid bullshit.** <br>
I'm only responsible for what I **personally agreed to.** <br>
Don't like it? Eat shit! 🖕

<br>

# 🧩 **Tags**
HTFMPL, just like Creative Commons (yeah, I shamelessly stole their homework), uses "Attributions" -- but we call them Tags, cause it sounds cooler and it's easier to remember.

Tags are shorthand rules slapped next to the license to show what others can or can't do with your work. <br>
Without tags, HTFMPL is just pretty wrapper without candy inside 🍬

> 💥 **"Conflicts:"** means **"Don't mix with these tags"** <br>
> 🤔 **Tag not listed?** Then it doesn't apply. Simple as that.

---

- 👤 **BA (By Authors):** <br>
Anyone using, editing or selling the work must credit the original author(s). 
<br> <img src="assets/tags/ba.gif" style="height: var(--gifh);">

---

- 💵 **NC (Non-Commercially):** <br>
You **can't profit** from the work, period. Even a single cent breaks the license.
<br> <img src="assets/tags/nc.gif" style="height: var(--gifh);">

---

- 🧬 **HD (Hereditary):** <br>
If you edit it and share it, you must use the **same license and tags** the original work had. <br>
Like passing DNA -- no tampering with bloodline.

---

- 🪽 **AF (Always Free):** <br>
You **can make money** off the work, but the work itself **must stay free**. <br>
No paywalls, no exclusives -- it's ours, not yours to hoard. <br>
If **HD** isn't tagged, this only applies to the original -- not your edits.
> [Conflicts: NC]

---

- 🔁 **ML (Multi-Licensing):** <br>
You're allowed to add **extra licenses** onto your edited version, as long as they don't break any of the original rules. <br>
Think of it like LEGO: stack 'em how you want -- just don't force pieces that don't fit.

<br>

# 🤖 **AI related Tags**

- ❌ **NA (No AI):** <br>
You **can't** use this work in any form of AI training, machine learning or generative models. <br>
In short: "Do your own homework, don't feed my shit to your toaster-brained robot"

---

- 👤 **AC (Strict AI Credit):** <br>
If you *do* use this work in an AI/ML project (and it's allowed), you **must** clearly credit the original author(s) in a **visible and easy-to-find** spot.
> [Conflicts: NA]

---

- 🚨 **AW (AI Watermark):** <br>
Using this in AI? Then every single output must be auto-labeled (eg: "Generated by AI") with a visible unremovable watermark  or equivalent notice. <br>
We ain't letting lazy clowns pass off 1-click slop as legit art.

> [Conflicts: NA]

<br>

# 🎯 Trigger Tags
Trigger tags are like alarm traps in a dungeon -- step on one, and the whole ass ceiling crashes your skull.

They don't enforce anything by themselves. Instead, they make all **unlocked** tags *optional suggestions* -- until a certain condition is met. **Locked** tags (marked with `!`) are always active no matter what. Once a trigger tag's condition is fulfilled, all those chill unlocked tags? *Boom* -- now they're mandatory.

`IF [condition] THEN [these tags become active and binding]`

Examples:
- `if-monetized: credit-required, no-ai`
- `if-edited: credit-required, under-the-same-terms`
- `if-nsfw: no-original-credits`

Trigger tags only make unlocked tags optional *until* their condition is triggered. Then those tags stop being chill suggestions and turn into hard rules.

- 💵 **TIC (Trigger -- If Commercially):** <br>
Unlocked tags **apply** only *if* the work **generates any type of financial gain**. <br>
No profit = no problem. Getting paid = obey the rules. <br>
> **[Conflicts: NC]**
---

- 🛠️ **TIM (Trigger -- If Modified):** <br>
Unlocked tags **apply** only *if* the work was **edited or changed in any way**. <br>
Leave it untouched = chill. Modify it = rules kick in.
---

- 🏠 **TEP (Trigger -- Excepting Personal Use):** <br>
Unlocked tags **don't apply** if the work is used for **personal non-commercial purposes.** <br>
Use it quietly? I don't care. Share or monetize? Follow the damn rules. 

<br>

# 🔒 Locked Tags (!)
Authors using HTFMPL have full opportunity **to make any tag "locked"**. A ***locked tag*** in context of this license means that tag applies **no matter what**, even if they would normally be affected by tags in the "Conditional-Tags" section. As a shortcut you have to **prefix them with "!" symbol** before the tag name (ex: `!BA`) - or point that out in any other way that is clear to the people using your work.

There's **no need** to use them if **every trigger tag is not present**, but it's **not** forbidden. For example (assuming that author haven't specified any custom terms) `HTFMPL v1 BA` will always be `HTFMPL v1 !BA`

<br>

# 📃 I Ain't Reading All That
For those kiddos who scroll TikTok all day and suffer from dementia.

So, HTFMPL is a *"I ain't sugarcoating it"* license. No legal mumbo-jumbo here, just straight up rules

Key points to avoid being a gremlin:

 - 🧩 **Tags:** Rules. No tag? No rule. Period.
 - 🎯 **Trigger tags:** This of these as "alert traps". Do something? You obey something.
 - 🔒 **Locked tags:** They stay locked in place, no matter how hard you pull. They're stayin' no matter what.
- ⚔️ **Tag Conflicts:** It ain't Star Wars, but some tags hate each other.
- 🧱 **Wall of Shame:** Act like a dick? Your username's on the wall. You're outta the sandbox. 🥀

---


- 👤 **Need credit?** No... until I say *Yes*. Let the word know who made this shit, MOTHERFUCKERS!!!
- 💵 **Can make cash?:** Yes... until I say *No*. Break that rule? And I am using your money to lit a campfire.
- 🤖 **For AI?:** Yes... until I say *No*. Break that rule? And I am going to build my own to go eat you alive at 3 AM.
- 🛠️ **Can edit?:** Yes! UNTIL I SAY FUCKING NO!

---

HTFMPL:

- ❗ **Disclaimers:** Seriously... READ THAT OR EAT SHIT!!!
- ➕ **Custom Terms:** This license ain't enough? No problem, you are the BOSS ✊


And the most important rule of them all: <br>
**Never stop creating.** 🩵
