# ‚öôÔ∏è Introduction
HTFMPL is public free-to-use License that values **simplicity**, **efficiency**, **transparency** and **readability** over the bloated-ass word count, seriously... why the fuck would I waste your time writting 10'000 pages of legal nonsense? It is written in **casual and chill** way to be eye-catching and actually fun to read, cause serious form is boring as fuck.

As long as the terms are as clear as my Minecraft inventory after death it's all good, right? Despite its vurgal and joking tone the license is totally serious - so don't fuck around... thank you. (greetings to the court, lol)

Authors using the license (thank you btw), have full right to do whatever the fuck they want with it - **as long as it doesn't violate the license this license is under on** (look at the top). You can edit whatever you want, write your own custom terms or use it as a base for your own license - in simpler terms, don't be a dick and respect my work (the license).

# ‚ÄºÔ∏èImportant
**Read it** before anything else, cause it might contain **very important** infomation.

- **I am speaking directly to you** - When I say "I", I don't mean some random dude - I mean **HaxoTF**.

- **Don't confuse people** - I know damn well what license I slapped this on. If you are using HTFMPL as a base for your own thing, you **must credit HaxoTF** and release it under a different, non-confussing name - or at least label it as `Edited HTFMPL`. By "using it as a base" I mean straight-up copying it 1:1 and tweaking things to your liking. You also have to include your own terms either by linking to them or putting long-ass text somewhere where people can easily find it. No shady business, no "oopsies", no excuses...

- **I am not a lawyer** - I am just a single dude writing this at home, vibing and chilling to the music. Despite my good intentions when creating this document I could make mistakes (I am just a human after all). Any part that is considered illegal or against your local law can be simply ignored, anything else is still valid. I would really appreciate that if you point out those mistakes and helped me to correct them.

- **Law is a final BOSS** - If your local law says "nope", then guess what - they win. Always respect the law, even if this license says otherwise. I am not picking fights with governments.

- **This license might change** - I, as the author have full right to fix, change or update the license - as long as those changes are not violating [Self-Rules](self-rules.md) - Always **check what version you are dealing with**, cause older versions might be outdated or lack important stuff.

- **You work is your Responsibility** - If someone violates the terms while your work was under the HTFMPL license, **I am not your lawyer or your babysitter**. I gave you ready-to-use terms to defend yourself, but if shit happens, it's **your** fight, not mine. I'll still cheer for you though <3

- **HTFMPL doesn't overwrite** - HTFMPL **cannot override** terms that already were stated by the original work, product or original author. If, for example the developer says "your levels are our property" then, your levels are their property, no matter what. HTFMPL only covers what it's allowed to, not what has been already locked down by someone else.

- **Updates aren't automatic** - Look, just because a new version of the HTFMPL comes out **doesn't** mean everything automatically switches to that version. Any works already under the previous version of the license will **stick to the version they're under** unless the **authors chooses to relicense** them. So, if you wanna stay up-to-date, you gotta make that call yourself.

- **Wall of Shame** - Listen up, you little gremlins - if you try to fuck with the rules, (whether it's the license or the work under HTFMPL), you are gonna end up on the [ban-list](ban-list.md). Once you are on that list, you are **officially banned** from **using anything under HTFMPL** or **the license itself**. We don't want you here if you came as a troll - The **only exception** is if you get **permission from author(s)**, but that **only applies** to **their specific work**.

# üß© Tags
HTFMPL same as Creative Commons contains "Attributions" (yeah, I yoinked that idea, cause it's cool) - But here, we call them "Tags" for simplicity sake. Tags are shortcuts for specific conditions that you can slap next to the license name to quickly show what other people can or cannot do with your work. HTFMPL relies on tags, and without them, it's basically useless...
<br>**If a tag is not present it can be ignored**.


- üë§ **BA (By Authors)** ‚Äì Anyone using, modifying, sharing or selling the work **must credit the original author(s)**. The credit must be **clearly visible** wherever the work is shared or point to a location where people can find the original author(s).

- üíµ **NC (Non Commercialy)** - The original work or the project the work is part of cannot be used for financial gain. Making even the smallest amount of money violates the license.

- ü™Ω **AF (Always Free)** - You are allowed to use the work for financial gain, but **no matter how you do it** the work **must stay free**. You **cannot** slap it behind a paywall - It's **not** your property so you don't to decide who the fuck has access to it. I share it with you, so share it with others and everything is skibidi sigma.

- üë∂ **HD (Hereditary)** - Anyone modifying and sharing the work must upload it under the same terms that original version of the work had.

- üîÅ **ML (Multi-Licensing)** - If the **HD tag is present** - Any modified versions of the work can be licensed under additional license(s) - **as long as those new terms don't violate original ones**. So yeah, stack rules like Discord kittens in your basement if you wanna. Just make sure they all obey the same daddy.

# üíª AI related Tags

- ü§ñ **NA (No AI)** - Work cannot be used as AI's training material, generative computer code, datasets or anything that is related to Machine Learning - In other words *"You do you, but don't grab my shit into your garbage AI model"*.

- üîí **AC (Strict AI Credit)** - If someone uses the work to train AI or any program related to Machine learning, they **must** clearly mention or list original author(s) of the work somewhere easy to find for anyone using the AI - No hiding credits in the basement, alright?

- ‚ÄºÔ∏è **AW (AI Watermark)** - If someone uses the work to train AI or any program related to Machine Learning, they **must** implement a script that adds a "Generated by AI" watermark (or something equally clear) on every output of the AI model that **cannot** be easily removed by anyone using or viewing the the generated content. This will ensure that no one can fake being an "artist" when all they did was hit a button.


# üìò Conditional Tags
Conditional Tags are tags that apply the license **only on certain conditions**. If none of these conditions are met **all tags that weren't hard-coded are considered invalid** (see below) - But don't get too excited yet my cutie patootie... don't forget about that authors can specify additional terms.

- üíµ **IC (If Commercially)** - License **applies only** if person using the work in any way **makes any kind of financial gain** from it.

- üõ†Ô∏è **IM (If Modified)** - License **applies only** if the original work by original author(s) was **modified** in any way. This license **doesn't apply** if the work is **used as an unmodified part of something else**, (ex: code libraries, music samples, krita brushes)

- üè† **EP (Excepting Personal Use)** - The license **doesn't apply** if person using the work does it only for **personal, non commercial usage** - Otherwise, they are still obligated to follow these terms - "Yeah, if you are keeping it for yourself, I don't care, but if you share it anywhere... follow the rules".

Order of these doesn't matter, but it's recommended, so people don't get a stroke while reading the license tags.


# üîí Hard-Coded Tags (!)
Authors using HTFMPL have full opportunity **to make any tag "hard-coded"**. A *hard-coded tag* in context of this license means that tag applies **no matter what**, even if they would normally be affected by tags in the "Condition-Tags" section. As a shortcut you have to put "!" symbol before the tag name (ex: `!BA`) - or point that out in any other way that is clear to the people using your work.

### Example
If work is put under a license: <br>
`HTFMPL v1 !BA HD IM` <br>
this means:
- **!BA** - You must mention the author(s) **no matter what**.
- **HD** - You must post the work under the same terms, **unless** it's original version of the work (IM).

(It doesn't make any sense, but explains things well..)

If you prefer to customize the license further without rewriting the whole galaxy, here's an example note:
```
This work is under HTFMPL v1 BA License, read more here: (link)
If OM tag is met then it's: HTFMPL v1 BA HD
```
It's that easy...

## ü§¨ Avoid Tag Conflicts
Some of the tags doesn't make sense together or are too confusing. Here's the example list of combinations that shouldn't be used:

- `NC + AF` - *So... I can't make money off it, but I can... as long as it's free, lol?*
- `NC + OC` - *So conditions apply only if I make money of it... but I can't make money of it... what?*
