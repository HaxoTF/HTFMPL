# üö® Welcome To The Shitshow üö®
HTFMPL is public free-to-use License that values **simplicity**, **efficiency**, **transparency** and **readability** over the bloated-ass word count. Seriously... why the fuck would I waste your time writing 10000 pages of legal diarrhea?

It is written in **casual, chill** and **in-your-face** way to actually **catch your eye** and **not make you fall asleep mid-scroll**.

In my not-so-humble opinion, everyone should have full freedom to customize their terms however the hell they want - **and that's why i spend my precious gamer hours making this shit**.

As long as the terms are as **clear as Walmart after Black Friday** (which is actually *pretty damn clear* if you survive the stampede), it's all good.

Despite it's vulgar, joking tone, the license should be taken seriously - so don't fuck around or you gonna find out. (Greetings to any future courts reading this, lmao.)

The license is considered "work" itself, so if you're using it (bless your chaotic soul), you have **full rights to customize, remix, or use it** - **as long as you respect the terms of the original license** (HTFMPL v1 BA AF). <br>
In short: **Don't be a dick, respect my work**, and **we're all cool**. ü§ù

<br>

# ‚ÄºÔ∏è READ IT OR EAT SHIT!
**Read it** before anything else, cause it might contain **very important** information. <br>
I am going to be real with you - most of mumbo-jumbo written here is just **ass-covering legal crap**.

- ü´µ **I Am Speaking Directly To You** <br>
When I say "I", I don't mean some random dude - I mean **HaxoTF**. <br>
When I say "you", I don't mean some random dude - I mean literally **you**.

---

- üåç **It Ain't Public Domain, Dumbass** <br>
I know damn well what license I slapped on this. If you are using HTFMPL as a base for your own shit, you **must credit HaxoTF** *and* release it under a **different, non-confusing name** - or at least label it as *"Edited HTFMPL"*. By *"using it as a base"*, I mean **straight-up copying it 1:1 and tweaking things to your liking**. You also have to include your own terms, either by linking to them or putting your own essay somewhere obvious to find. No shady business, no "oopsies," no excuses...

---

- üíº **I Am Not a Lawyer** <br>
I am just a single dude writing this at home, vibin' and chillin' to the music. Despite my good intentions when creating this document, I could have made some mistakes (I am just a human, after all). Any part that is considered illegal or against your local law can simply be ignored; anything else is still valid. I would really appreciate it if you pointed out those mistakes and helped me correct them. **But if you try to sue me over a typo - go douch glass...** üñï

---

- üëæ **Law is a Final BOSS** <br>
If your local law says "nope," then guess what - they win. Always follow your country's laws, even if this license says otherwise. I am not picking fights with governments - unless you're **some smelly-ass dictator out here making another dumpster-fire Red Star OS while disrespecting my community**. In that case, I hope you gonna drown in diarrhea. üñï Stay legal, don't be dumb.

---

- ‚ùî **This License Might Change** <br>
I as the author (yes, the one and only HaxoTF, motherfucker), have full right to fix, change, or yeet parts of the license - as long as I don't break my own [Self-Rules](self-rules.md). Always **check what version you are dealing with,** because older versions might be outdated, buggy, or just plain ass compared to newer ones.

---

- üõ°Ô∏è **Your Work is Your Responsibility** <br>
If someone violates the terms while your work was under the HTFMPL license, **I am not your lawyer or your babysitter.** I gave you ready-to-use terms to defend yourself, but if shit happens, it's *your* fight, not mine. I'll still cheer for you though. ü©µ

---

- üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **HTFMPL Ain't Magic Eraser** <br>
Listen up, fam. HTFMPL ain't some cheat code to erase rules that the OG author already slapped and glued to their work. If some game dev decides, "Yo, your levels are OURS now", guess what? Your levels are theirs. No magic powers from HTFMPL can override that shit. Basically, HTFMPL does what it says it can do, but it ain't going around smashing other people's property like a wrecking ball. It's not here to start a fight with what's already been locked down. Got it? Cool üññ

---

- üîÅ **Updates Aren't Automatic** <br>
Look, just because a new version of the HTFMPL drops, **doesn't mean your shit automatically updates itself**. Nah, anything already under an older version stays here - unless the author manually decides to relicense it. So, if you wanna stay fresh and not be stuck on some fossilized rules from the stone age, **you gotta make that call yourself**. Ain't not autopilot here, chief üí•

---

- üß± **Wall of Shame** <br>
Listen up, you little shitty gremlins: **If you violate the rules of the license** --- whether it's the license itself or the work under HTFMPL --- you're getting **thrown straight into [ban-list](ban-list.md)**. Once you are on that list, **you lose every single goddamn right** to **anything under HTFMPL** or **the license itself** --- in short: *"All rights reserved"* for you, you aren't welcome if you came as a troll. The **only exception** is if the **original author(s)** of work give you permission *or* clearly state that *"HTFMPL ban-list doesn't apply"* --- but that **only applies** to **their specific work** --- **not the whole license**. I won't place people on the [ban-list](ban-list.md) if they **violated the rules by accident and took the time to correct their mistake** --- I am not a monster, after all. Still unsure what you can be banned for? [click here to find out](ban-list.md) <br>
*Fuck around -> Find out*
---

- üí© **I Don't Agree to Bullshit** <br>
If you are one of those gremlins who thinks they can magically force me to something --- spoiler alert: **you are fucking wrong!** If you try to hijack the license by slapping your own custom terms onto it, the *"Wall of Shame"* rule will be enforced. Example: If you add some clownery like "HaxoTF is obligated to pay me gazillion dollars if someone breaks the rules", that's considered invalid bullshit, because I never agreed to that garbage --- I am only responsible for what I personally promise. nothing more, nothing less. Nice try buddy, but not this time... üñï

<br>

# üß© Tags
HTFMPL same as Creative Commons contains "Attributions" (yeah, I yoinked that idea, cause it's genius) - But here, we call them "Tags" for simplicity sake. Tags are shortcuts for specific conditions that you can slap next to the license name to quickly show what other people can or cannot do with your work. HTFMPL relies on tags, and without them, it's basically useless...

By *"Conflicts: tags"* I mean *"Shouldn't be used with: (tags)"* <br >
**If a tag is not present it can be ignored**.


- üë§ **BA (By Authors):** <br>
Anyone using, modifying, sharing or selling the work **must credit the original author(s)**. The credit must be **clearly visible** wherever the work is shared - or point to a location where people can find the original author(s).

---

- üíµ **NC (Non-Commercially):** <br>
The original work or the project the work is part of **cannot be used for any type of financial gain**. **Any amount of profit**, no matter how small, **violates this license**.

---

- üß¨ **HD (Hereditary):** <br>
Anyone modifying and sharing the work **must** upload it under the **same terms** that the original version of the work had. DNA shall be passed.

---

- ü™Ω **AF (Always Free):** <br>
You are allowed to use the work for any type of financial gain, but **no matter how you do it** the work **must stay free**. You **cannot** slap it behind a paywall - It's **not your property** so you **don't get to decide** who the fuck has access to it. I share it with you, so share it with others and everyone is happy. If **HD** tag is **not present**, it applies **only to the original work**, **otherwise** any modifications or adaptations **must stay free**.
<br> *[Conflicts: NC]*

---

- üîÅ **ML (Multi-Licensing):** <br>
any modified versions of the work can be licensed under **additional licenses** - **as long as those new terms don't violate original ones**. So yeah, stack rules like computer components if you wanna, just make sure they are **compatible**.

<br>

# üíª AI related Tags

- ü§ñ **NA (No AI):** <br>
Work **cannot** be used as **AI's** training material, generative computer code, datasets or **anything** that is **related to Machine Learning** - In other words *"You do you, but don't grab my shit into your garbage AI model"*.
---

- üîí **AC (Strict AI Credit):** <br>
If someone uses the work **to train AI** or any program **related to Machine learning**, they **must** clearly **mention** or **list original author(s)** of the work somewhere **easy to find** for anyone using the AI. No hiding credits in the basement, alright?
<br> *[Conflicts: NA]*
---

- ‚ÄºÔ∏è **AW (AI Watermark):** <br>
If someone uses the work **to train AI** or any program **related to Machine Learning**, they **must** implement a script that adds a **"Generated by AI" watermark** (or something equally clear) on **every output** of the AI model that **cannot be easily removed** by anyone using or viewing the generated content. This will ensure that no one can fake being an "artist" when all they did was hit a button.
<br> *[Conflicts: NA]*

<br>

# üéØ Trigger Tags
Trigger tags are like alarm traps in a dungeon --- step on one, and the whole ass ceiling drops on you.

They don't enforce anything by themselves. Instead, they make all **unlocked** tags *optional suggestions* -- until a certain condition is met. **Locked** tags (marked with `!`) are always active no matter what. Once a trigger tag's condition is fulfilled, all those chill unlocked tags? *Boom* --- now they're mandatory.

`IF [condition] THEN [these tags become active and binding]`

Examples:
- `if-monetized: credit-required, no-ai`
- `if-edited: credit-required, under-the-same-terms`
- `if-nsfw: no-original-credits`

Trigger tags only make unlocked tags optional *until* their condition is triggered. Then those tags stop being chill suggestions and turn into hard rules.

- üíµ **TIC (If Commercially):** <br>
Unlocked tags **apply** only *if* the work **generates any type of financial gain**.
> No profit = No problem. Getting paid = obey the rules. <br>
> **[Conflicts: NC]**
---

- üõ†Ô∏è **TIM (If Modified):** <br>
Unlocked tags **apply** only *if* the work was **edited or changed in any way**.
> Leave it untouched = chill. Modify it = rules kick in.
---

- üè† **TEP (Excepting Personal Use):** <br>
Unlocked tags **don't apply** if the work is used for **personal non-commercial purposes.**
> Use it quietly? I don't care. Share or monetize? Follow the damn rules. 

<br>

# üîí Locked Tags (!)
Authors using HTFMPL have full opportunity **to make any tag "locked"**. A ***locked tag*** in context of this license means that tag applies **no matter what**, even if they would normally be affected by tags in the "Conditional-Tags" section. As a shortcut you have to **prefix them with "!" symbol** before the tag name (ex: `!BA`) - or point that out in any other way that is clear to the people using your work.

There's **no need** to use them if **every trigger tag is not present**, but it's **not** forbidden. For example (assuming that author haven't specified any custom terms) `HTFMPL v1 BA` will always be `HTFMPL v1 !BA`

<br>

# üìÉ TL:DR For Your Goldfish Brain
So, HTFMPL is a *"I ain't reading all that"* license. No legal mumbo-jumbo here, just straight up rules

Key points to avoid being a gremlin:

üß© **Tags = Rules:** <br>
Tags are these little cutie patooties that slap *"YOU CAN'T DO THAT, BITCH"* chains on your ass. If you try to break free **they will eat you alive at 3 AM**. No tag = no rule, end of the story

- üîí Some tags are **locked** (marked with "!") - they are like those little, stubborn brats
that will **never leave you alone**. They can't be ignored or moved by any goddamn crane.

- üéØ **Trigger tags** exists, cause sometimes it's not just "yes" or "no", it's "maybe if your father returns from the milk quest (titty water ü•õ)". Basically certain tags **activate only** if specific things happen (like money being made, or edits being done - then the other rules kick in)
---

üß± **"Wall of Shame":** <br>
Break the rules? Congrats, you are on that list. Wanna be a troll? That's cute - but I might just let my finger slip and *boom* - your name is glued to the shame archives. Don't even try to play innocent if you're not - fix your mess or I will make sure you stay here permanently.

And the most important thing of them all: <br>
**Never stop creating ü©µ**
