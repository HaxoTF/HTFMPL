# ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions
For those moment when diarrhea strikes and you're banned from scrolling TikTok while planting fat load.

This FAQ should answer everything - whether you're regular person, a curious gremlin, or even the court itself if shit goes wrong.

<br>

# üìò Usage

### ‚ùì **Do I have to pay to use HTFMPL?** <br>
**Hell no**, This license is **free and publicly available** to everyone by **default**. <br>

But - if you landed on the [ban-list](banlist.md) - then you can only **dream about it**. Cry louder üíîü•Ä <br>
Just to be sure: Judgement is **based on your actions**, if you **didn't** act like a dick, you're **good** and **not** on that list.

*"Fuck around and find out"*

<br>

### ‚ùì **Can I modify HTFMPL for my project?** <br>
Yeah, absolutely. When I say that the license itself (HTFMPL) is "customizable", I literaly mean that it's **customizable as fuck** - you **can** tweak it, remix it, or even Frankenstein it into something new for your project.

BUT if you do modify it, you **must credit HaxoTF** as the original author and either rename your version to avoid confusion **or** clearly label it as `Edited HTFMPL`.

<br>

### ‚ùì **Can I use HTFMPL for commercial work?**
Depends...

If you mean **the license itself** (HTFMPL) - Yeah, you **can slap it on commercial work** or even tweak it into paid license if you feel like it - as long as the **original** versions of the license **stays free to the public** (doesn't apply to any modifications of HTFMPL).

BUT if you are talking about **works licensed under HTFMPL** (someone else's art, code etc.) - **it depends on tags** (those little cutie patooties like: BA, NC, AF, HD etc.) **or custom terms** that author has specified, always check those 2 things before you start doing anything with the work.

<br>

### ‚ùì **Can I add extra terms when using HTFMPL for my own work?**
When I say it's **"customizable"**, I literally mean that **it's customizable as fuck**. You can **add your own terms**, and those terms even might **override the current ones**.

So yea, go ahead make it your own - just don't break the damn license or act like a gremlin about it.

<br>

# üí• What If's

### ‚ùì **What if someone violates the license rules?**
If the violation was **intentional** - **no matter the excuse** - they get thrown onto the [ban-list](ban-list.md), our little jail for gremlins. Once you're on that list, you **officially lose every single goddamn right** to anything **licensed under HTFMPL** or the **license itself**.

In short: *"all rights reserved"* for you - you can't do shit with it anymore. You want back in? Too fucking bad... unless the **original author personally forgives** your sorry ass.

If the law allows it, you **can get smacked legally** too - not my problem, figure it out yourself.

<br>

### ‚ùì **What if HaxoTF dies or disappears?** <br>
Let's keep it simple:
If I die, disappear or get kidnapped by aliens, **HTFMPL's development gets frozen** like your brain during brainrot overdose. No new rules, no new updates - **it stays exactly as it is** - **unless I respawn** or return from my milk quest.

This is to make damn sure that some big-ass corporation can't slide in, twist it into a garbage money machine, or abuse the license to hoard all the works under it. Seriously... **fuck you** if you're one of those shady goblins. **I hope you choke on a sticky, big-ass dick**.

However, the community can still use it, spread it, and vibe with it. <br>
Just remember: **what's written stays written** - no necromancer shit where someone "guesses" what I would've wanted.

<br>

# ‚ùî Other

### ‚ùì Are you racist/x-phobic, HaxoTF?
**Fuck no**. Why the fuck would you even think that? I vibe with people exactly **as they are** - no matter skin, flags, shapes or funny-ass pronouns they roll with ‚ú®üåà <br>

I roast, I meme, I offend - because **I love all types of humour**, even the spicy shit. ("Instagram Reels" should tell you everything you need to know ü§°). **Nothing** written here is meant to hurt your fragile, poor soul personally - it's for the sake of laughter, chaos, and memes, **not to make anyone cry in the corner**.
