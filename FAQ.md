# ‚ùì Frequently Asked Question
For those moment when diarrhea strikes and you're banned from scrolling TikTok while planting C4.

1. **Can I modify HTFMPL for my project?** <br>
Yeah, absolutely. The license itself (HTFMPL) is super customizable - you can tweak it, remix it, or even Frankenstein it into something new for your project. BUT if you do you  **must** credit HaxoTF as the original author and etheir rename your version to avoid confusion **or** clearly label it as `Edited HTFMPL`.

2. **Can I use HTFMPL for commercial work?** <br>
Depends... If you mean the license itself (HTFMPL) - Yeah, you can put it on commercial work or even tweak it into paid license if you feel like it. But if you are talking about **works licensed under HTFMPL** (someone else's art, code etc.) - **it depends on tags** (those little gremlins like: BA, NC, AF, HD etc.), always check the tags before you start doing anything with the work.

3. **Do I have to pay to use HTFMPL?** <br>
Nope, This license is free and publicly available to everyone by default. You **cannot** put it behind a paywall - It must stay "open-source" at all times (GNU GPL vibe, but without copyleft chains).
