# ‚ùî Definitions
This way I will make sure you know what the fuck do I mean by specific terms. <br>
Anything here can be changed if necessary.



### üë§ Author

- **Author** - Human (or any living being) who **created the work** or any version of it. Including modifications or adaptations.

- **Original Author** - A Author that made the **original work**



### üé® Work

- **Work** - Anything created by a human (or any living being). This includes (but is not limited to): drawings, paintings, sculptures, animations, code, poetry, books, music, instrumentals, tracks, samples, brushes, sculptures, designs, characters, stories, sfx, sprites, and many other things that I forgot to mention.

- **Original Work** - The work that was created from scratch or had enough human (or any living being's) input to be considered its **own** thing. This doesn't rely on or copy anything else that makes it a part of another work.



### üß© Tags

- **Tag** - In context of HTFMPL license, a **tag** is a quick-ass notation that **defines specific terms**. It might be applied to the work under the license. Think of it like a shortcut to the long-ass text.

- **Conditional Tag** - a **tag** that applies the license only on specific conditions, but **doesn't have any impact** on tags that were **hard-coded**.

- **Hard-Coded Tag** - a **tag** whose terms must be followed **no matter what** - It's the tags way of saying "I am staying here and you can't do shit about it"




### ‚ùî Other Terms

- **Open-Source** - Term usually seen in the programming industry, it means that the computer code of specific software is **open to the public** - It can be viewed, modified or redistributed by anyone, the best examples are: Linux, Krita, Gimp or Open Office - Open-Source **cannot** be a already build and locked in thing like: Microsoft Windows, FL Studio or Adobe Photoshop - For simplicity sake I extend the definition of "open-source" to every industry - Think of it like: .KRA is your source-code, and .PNG is your executable, if you open the .KRA file to the public, it's considered open-source.
