# ‚ùî Definitions
This way I will make sure you know what the fuck do I mean by specific terms. <br>
Anything here can be changed if necessary.

- **Work** - Anything created by a human (or any living thing). This includes (but is not limited to): drawings, paintings, sculptures, animations, code, poetry, books, music, instrumentals, tracks, samples, brushes, sculptures, designs, characters, stories, sfx, sprites, and many other things that I forgot to mention.

- **Original Work** - The work that was created from scratch or had enough human (or any living being's) input to be considered its **own** thing. This doesn't rely on or copy anything else that makes it a part of another work.

- **Author** - Human (or living being) who created the work or any version of it. Including modifications or adaptions.

- **Tag** - In context of HTFMPL license, a **tag** is a quick-ass notation that defines specific terms that might be applied to the work using the license. Think of it like a shortcut to the long-ass text.

- **Hard-Coded Tags** - A **hard-coded tag** is a **tag** whose terms must be followed **no matter what**. It's the tags way of saying "I am staying here and you can't do shit about it"
