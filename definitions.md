# ‚ùî Definitions
This document makes sure you actually know **what the fuck do I mean** when I throw specific terms around. <br>
Nobody should have to dig through some boring, long-ass legal paper just to figure out what a word means - **fuck that**.

**Anything here can be changed if needed** <br>
If something is missing here or you're like "yo, what the hell does it mean?" - **hit me up directly** and I'll slap it in here faster than you can say *"what the ligma"*.

I love explaining things anyway ü©µ


# üë§ Author - Related

### **"Author"** <br>
**Explanation:** Human (or any living being) who **created the *[work](#work)*** or any version of it. Including modifications or adaptations.

---

### **"Original Author"** <br>
**Explanation:** Human (or any living being) who **created the *[original work](#original-work)***.

<br>

# üé® **Work - Related**

### **"Work"** <br>
**Explanation:** Anything created by a human (or any living being). This includes (but is not limited to): drawings, paintings, sculptures, animations, code, poetry, books, music, instrumentals, tracks, samples, brushes, sculptures, designs, characters, stories, sfx, sprites, and many other things that I forgot to mention.

---

### **"Original Work"** <br>
**Explanation:** The *[work](#work)* that was created from scratch or had enough human (or any living being's) input to be considered **its own thing**. This doesn't rely on or copy anything else that makes it a part of another work.

<br>

# üß© **Tag - Related**

### **"Tag"** <br>
**Explanation:** In context of HTFMPL license, a *tag* is a quick-ass notation that **defines specific terms**. It might be applied to the work under the license. Think of it like a shortcut to the long-ass text. They are usually placed next to the license name, for example: `This work is under HTFMPL v1 BA HD AF` - where ***"BA"***, ***"HD"*** and ***"AF"*** are the tags I am talking about. In simpler words, for example: instead of saying *"get the fuck out"*, you might just say *"GTFO"* - it's much quicker.

---

### **"Trigger Tag"** <br>
**Explanation:** a *[tag](#tag)* that applies the license **only on specific conditions**, but doesn't have any impact on tags that were ["locked"](#locked-tag). If atleast **one of them** is met, **then all tags are activated**. These tags are like alert traps - if one of them is triggered, the whole castle will come for you.

--- 

### **"Locked Tag"** <br>
**Explanation:** A *[tag](#tag)* whose terms must be followed **no matter what** - It's the tags way of saying: *"I am staying here and you can't do shit about it"*. These tags **cannot be removed** by any [trigger tag](#trigger-tag), excepting additional terms specified by the [author](#author).

<br>

# ‚ùî **Other Terms**

### **"Source-Code"** <br>
**Explanation:** Term usually seen in the **programming industry**, it refers to the **computer code** behind specific software. Source-Code defines how the program should behave  In case of HTFMPL for simplicity sake, it will refer to every industry. 

---

### **"Open-Source"** <br>
**Explanation:** Term usually seen in the **programming industry**, it means that the "source-code" of specific software is **open to the public** - It can be viewed, modified or redistributed by anyone, the best examples are: Linux, Krita, Gimp or Open Office - Open-Source **cannot** be a already build and locked in thing like: Microsoft Windows, FL Studio or Adobe Photoshop - think of it like: .KRA is your source-code, and .PNG is your executable, if you open the .KRA file to the public, **it's considered *"open-source"***. For HTFMPL needs: this definition is extended to every industry **as explained in "Open-Source" definition**.

<br>

# ü§™ **HTFMPL Slang**

### üîë **Key Concepts:**

### **"Fuck around and find out"**
**Explanation:** This catchphrase is a clear warning that actions have real consequences, usually used when someone is being reckless or ignoring the rules. It's a HTFMPL's way of saying *"test the rules and face the consequences"*.

---

### **"Wall of Shame" or "Ban-List"** <br>
**Explanation:** This refers to a list of users who violated the rules and lost all rights to HTFMPL and works under it. It's pretty self-explanatory. But yea, as you might realise authors have real power over their work so they can just "yo, the ban-list doesn't apply". Their work - no mine - their rules - not mine.
