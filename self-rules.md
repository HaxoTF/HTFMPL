# üìú HaxoTF's Self-Rules (WIP)
I (HaxoTF), as the original author of HTFMPL need some god-damn rules, cause I cannot unleash chaos without giving you a way to defend yourself. So‚Ä¶ I prepared a whole sexy DLC full of them. This should reassure you that I won‚Äôt devolve into a brainless piece of shit. And hey - You don't even have to link this document when you're using HTFMPL, cause I am the one already pinned to the wall - waiting for someone to punish me~

Have fun finding something to slap me for <3

### 0. üî• **Loyal to the Rules** <br>
I (HaxoTF), as the author of HTFMPL have full responsibility to follow every rule listed here. If I intentionally (accidents happen) break any of them or act like a dick, I lose my rights to the license myself - and only ones who can restore them is the community itself. Yep, even I am not immune to chaos I've created - If I lose my rights, development of HTFMPL is completely frozen until I am officialy forgiven.
<br>
And just to be clear - "Community" doesn't mean some bunch of random dudes that just stumbled in; <br>
It means the real ones - the people that use, contribute or care about the license

### 1. üõ†Ô∏è **WIP, or Cannot Be Edited** <br>
Any changes to HTFMPL can only be applied to files marked as "WIP" (Work in Progress). Once document is finalized, it's locked in - no more edits. If I want to make even the tiniest change I must release it as new version or subversion (This rule applies only to files starting with `HTFMPL`).

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Broken links may be updated for usability, but actual terms and content of the file remain unchanged.

### 2. üí° **Bond to the Vibe** <br>
All versions of HTFMPL must stick to the same tone, style and format. I will avoid switching between formal and casual, or dumping overly complex legal jargon without a valid reason (like, unless some SWAT team breaks my door down like LEGO set and stops me from writing this while cooking meth). Keep it clear, keep it fun.

### 3. üîí **No Backpedaling** <br>
Once a rule or tag is implemented, it **cannot** be undone without a clear and reasonable explanation. If I decide to allow something, it stays that way - unless an edit is necessary (and I better have good damn reason for it).

### 4. üîç **Transparency of Changes** <br>
When the new subversion (v1.x) of HTFMPL is released, I (HaxoTF), as the author of the license must list all changes - either detailed or general way - inside the `changelog.md` file. This way, you are assured nothing is hidden from you, and you are not blindly accepting any ninja edits. If I forget to list any change, you as the user have full right to call me out and request a correction. Fair and square.

### 5. ‚¨ÖÔ∏è **Backward Compatibility** <br>
All changes applied to HTFMPL **must not** mess up previous subversions of the license - In simpler words: `HTFMPL v1.1` should work pretty much the same as `HTFMPL v1` - just with some new toys to play with.  *Unless...* the reasonable reason is given.

### 6. ü§ù **Your Opinion Matters**
We, as the HTFMPL community, are in this together. I (HaxoTF), as the original author, might ask for feedback, suggestions or ideas from the community - but the final word stays with me. I'll always listen, but I won't base changes on random garbage complaints. Quality input only, my friend.

### 7. ‚ú® **Clarity**
Every term in the HTFMPL should be crystal clear. If someone has to scratch their head while reading the license, it's my responsibility to fix it. I will always claim for clarity and avoid legal bloat.

### 8. ‚õî **I'm Not Above The Law, I Just Write It**
Just because I made HTFMPL **doesn't** mean I get special treatment. If work is licensed under HTFMPL, it's **not** my property. I have to follow the same rules as everyone else - **unless the original author gives me permission**. <br>
No shortcuts. No sneaky overrides.

I will always respect your work. <br>
Never stop creating ü©µ
