# üìú HaxoTF's Self-Rules (WIP)
I (HaxoTF), as the original author of HTFMPL need some god-damn rules, cause I cannot unleash chaos without giving you a way to defend yourself. So‚Ä¶ I prepared a whole sexy DLC full of them. This should reassure you that I won‚Äôt devolve into a brainless piece of shit. And hey - You don't even have to link this document when you're using HTFMPL, cause I am the one already pinned to the wall - waiting for someone to punish me~

Have fun finding something to slap me for <3

0. üî• **Loyal to the Rules** <br>
I (HaxoTF), as the author of HTFMPL have full responsibility to follow every rule listed here. If I intentionally break any of them or act like a dick (accidents happen), I lose my rights to the license myself - and only ones who can restore them is the community itself. Yep, even I am not immune to chaos I've created - If I lose my rights, development of HTFMPL is completely frozen until I am officialy forgiven.
<br>
And just to be be clear - "Community" doesn't mean some random bunch of random dudes that just stumbled in; <br>
It means the real ones - the people that use, contribute or care about the license

1. üìù **WIP, or Cannot Be Edited** <br>
Any changes to HTFMPL can be only be applied to files marked as "WIP" (Work in Progress). Once document is finalized, it's locked in - no more edits. If I want to make even the tiniest change I must release it as new version or subversion. Once it's done it's done. This rule applies only to files starting with `HTFMPL`

2. üí° **Bond to the Vibe** <br>
All versions of HTFMPL must stick to the same tone, style and format. I will avoid switching beetwen formal and causal, or dumping overly complex legal jargon without valid reason (like, unless some SWAT team breaks my door down like LEGO set and stops me from writing this while cooking meth). Keep it clear, keep it fun.
