# ‚öôÔ∏è Introduction
HTFMPL is public free-to-use License that values **simplicity**, **efficiency**, **transparency** and **readability** over the bloated-ass word count, seriously... why the fuck would I waste your time writting 10'000 pages of legal nonsense? It is written in **casual and chill** way to be eye-catching and actually fun to read, cause serious form is boring as fuck.

As long as the terms are as clear as my Minecraft inventory after death it's all good, right? Despite its vurgal and joking tone the license is totally serious - so don't fuck around... thank you. (greetings to the court, lol)

Authors using the license (thank you btw), have full right to do whatever the fuck they want with it - **as long as it doesn't violate the license this license is under on** (look at the top). You can edit whatever you want, write your own custom terms or use it as a base for your own license - in simpler terms, don't be a dick and respect my work (the license).



# üß© Tags
HTFMPL same as Creative Commons contains "Attributions" (I yoinked that idea, cause it's cool) - But here we call them "Tags" for simplicity sake. Tags are shortcuts for specific conditions that you can slap next to the license name to quickly define what other people can do and cannot do with your work. HTFMPL relies on tags, and without them, it's basically useless...


- üë§ **BA (By Authors)** ‚Äì Anyone using, modifying, or selling the work must credit the original author(s). The credit must be clearly visible wherever the work is shared or point to a location where people can find the original author(s).

- üíµ **NC (Non Commercialy)** - The original work or the project the work is part of cannot be used for financial gain. Making even the smallest amount of money violates the license.

- ü™Ω **AF (Always Free)** - You are allowed to use the work for financial gain, but regardless of the money making method the work must be always free, it is forbidden to put it behind a paywall.

- üë∂ **HD (Hereditary)** - Anyone modifying and sharing the work must upload it under the same terms that original version of the work had.

- **AI (AI Friendly)** - Anyone using the work have permission to use it to train any kind of Artificial Inteligence, put it in datasets or do other things related to AI.



# üö´ Only-Tags
Only-Tags (sounds kinda like OF) are tags that apply the license **only on certain conditions**. If none of these conditions are met **all tags that weren't hard-coded are considered invalid** - But don't get too excited yet my cutie patootie... don't forget about that authors can specify additional terms.

- **OC (Only Commercially)** - License applies only if person uses the work for financial gain.

- **OM (Only Modified)** - License applies only if the work by original author(s) were modified in any way. This license doesn't apply if the work was only an unmodified part of something else, (ex. programming libraries, music samples, krita brushes)

Order of these attributions doesn't matter, but it's recommended, so people don't get a stroke while reading the license tags.



# üîí Hard-Coded Tags (!)
Authors using HTFMPL have full opportunity **to make any tag "hard-coded"**. A *hard-coded tag* in context of this license means that tag applies **no matter what**, even if they would normally be affected by tags in the "Only-Tags" section. As a shortcut you have to put "!" symbol before the tag name (ex: `!BA`) - or point that out in any other way that is clear to the people using your work.

### Example
If work is put under a license: <br>
`HTFMPL v1 !BA HD OM` <br>
this means:
- **!BA** - You must mention the author(s) **no matter what**.
- **HD** - You must post the work under the same terms, **unless** it's original version of the work (OM).

(It doesn't make any sense, but explains things well..)

If you prefer to customize the license further without rewriting the whole galaxy, here's an example note:
```
This work is under HTFMPL v1 BA License, read more here: (link)
If OM tag is met then it's: HTFMPL v1 BA HD
```
It's that easy...

## ü§¨ Avoid Tag Conflicts
Some of the tags doesn't make sense together or are too confusing. Here's the example list of combinations that shouldn't be used:

- `NC + AF` - *So... I can't make money off it, but I can... as long as it's free, lol?*
- `NC + OC` - *So conditions apply only if I make money of it... but I can't make money of it... what?*
