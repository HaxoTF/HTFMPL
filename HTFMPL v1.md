These licenses are not a part of HTFMPL and have no real impact over this document.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Introduction
HTFMPL is free to use License written by me (HaxoTF) that values simplicity, efficiency, transparency and readability over the word count. The author(s) are allowed to use the license freely to their needs. They can modify

### üí¨ Default Rules
Default rules define the the initial conditions of the license as long as they were not modified by tags or clearly stated by the author(s) using the license. For example if the default rule "No AI" is mixed with "AI (AI Friendly)" the rule "No AI" is considered invalid.

### üß© Tags
HTFMPL similarly to Creative Commons contains "Attributions" that were called "Tags" here for simplicity sake, which are shortcuts for specific conditions that are fast to write next to a name of the license. You are free to link any tag next to that license to quickly define what you expect from people using your work in any way.

- **BA (By Authors)** - Anyone using the work in any way, modifying or selling it must leave a fair credit to the original author(s) that have created it. The credit must be clearly visible where the work was shared to anyone that can view it or it must point in some way to a place where people can find an original author.

- **NC (Non Commercialy)** - The original work, modified version or the project the work is part of cannot be used for financial gain. Making even the smallest amount of money violates the license.

- **AF (Always Free)** - You are allowed to use the work for financial gain, but regardless of the money making method the work must be always free, it is forbidden to put it behind a paywall.

- **HD (Hereditary)** - Anyone modifying and sharing the work must upload it under the same terms that original version of the work had.

### üö´ Only-Tags
Only-tags are tags that apply the license only on certain conditions. There must be at least one condition met to apply the license to the work.

- **OC (Only Commercially)** - License applies only if person uses the work for financial gain.

- **OM (Only Modified)** - License applies only if the work by original author(s) were modified in any way. This license doesn't apply if the work was only unmodified part of something else, (ex. programming libraries, music samples, krita brushes)

Order of these attributions doesn't matter, but it's recommended to do so for better readability.

### ü§¨ Avoid Tag Conflicts
Some of the tags doesn't make sense together or are too confusing. Here's the example list of combinations that shouldn't be used:

- `NC + AF` - *So... I can't make money off it, but I can... as long as it's free, lol?*
- `NC + OC` - *So conditions apply only if I make money of it... but I can't make money of it... what?*
