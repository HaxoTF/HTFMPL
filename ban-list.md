# 🧱 Wall of Shame (AKA: Ban-List)
All users that **can't play in the same sandbox anymore**. 💔🥀

Let me make this **crystal fucking clear**: <br>
> Everyone listed here has **permamently lost every single goddamn right** to use **anything** under HTFMPL - or the **license itself**.
> 
> They **cannot**:
> - Put their work under HTFMPL
> - Use or remix works under HTFMPL
> - Edit, distribute or modify the license

That's what *"finding out"* means. <br>
Fuck around -> find out.

### 🗣️ **Unless...**
The original author of specific work **personally forgives their sorry ass**, <br>
**or** <br>
they clearly state that *"HTFMPL's ban-list doesn't apply"* to their work <br>

👉 In that case, **only** that specific work is forgiven - **not the whole damn license**.

**Authors = Gods** over their own shit. <br>
Their decision **is final**. <br>
So if you stay banned, don't come crying to me, bozo. 🤡

<br>

# ⁉️ What You Can Be Punished For
Some people really out here playin' dumb, so let me spell it for you.<br>
### 🚨 **You can get slapped on the Wall of Shame for:**
- **Violating the license rules or custom terms set by the author** <br>
*(also known as *"copyright infringement"* - yea, that big scary word)*

- **Hijacking the license to pull some dumb power move** <br>
*(eg: "Hey Haxo, pay me million dollar or I sue you" - nice try, asshole)*
- **Scamming people while your work was under HTFMPL** <br>
*(if you say it's "finished and stable", then eats someone's PC alive - that's on you)*

- **Editing the license and pretending it's still HTFMPL** <br>
*(Seriously, it ain't public domain, bozo)*

- **Slapping HTFMPL on something you don't even own** <br>
*(stealing shit is only fair if they allow you to steal shit)*

### 😇 **But you are probably safe if**:
- **You screwed up by accident, but owned it and fixed it ASAP.** <br>
*(don't be stubborn like a little brat - you accepted the terms so follow 'em)*

- **The custom terms were written like cryptic alien runes and only the author could understand them.** <br>
*(you can't agree to something written in a sci-fi fever dream, do you?)*

- **The terms were unfair AS FUCK** <br>
*(No, they can't just slap HTFMPL on a "free sprite pack" and demand your whole desktop directory - that's not how it works, clown)*

- **You were just vibing and someone else dragged you into this mess** <br>
*(punishing innocents ain't the vibe here)*

<br>

# 💬 Forgiveness Request
Fell on your face and wanna crawl back in?

You can try begging for forgiveness from the community. <br>
But again: **not my problem**. <br>
They decide, not me.

🛑 Automated bot accounts, spammy trolls, and other degeens: **no forgiveness, no second chances, eat shit** 🤖🖕

<br>

# ⚖️ The Final Word
At the end of the day, **my word is a law here**. <br>
No appeals. No "but but but..." whining. <br>
You're on the list until I personally decide you are not. <br>
**Deal with it.** 👑

<br>

# ⛔ Banned-Users
If they respect the ban-list and leave you alone - **do not harass them**. <br>
**Mockery is only fair game** if they keep acting like clowns and ignoring the rules. <br>
**Live and let live.** Break that, and **you might find your ass on this list too**. 💀

> ❗ REGARDLESS OF ANYTHING **DO NOT**:
> - Harrass them **if they respect the ban-list**
> - Doxx or **leak any personall info**
> - Forget that everyone **has a right to feel safe at their own home**

This list exists to **set boundaries**, not incite drama. **Don't act like an asshole**.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This ban-list includes **both real and joke entries**. If you're unsure which is which, either you've done something shady or your sense of humour needs firmware update.
